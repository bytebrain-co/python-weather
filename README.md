# python-weather
A weather application that fetches data from a weather API and displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant information.


To use this code, you'll need to sign up for a free API key from the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/) and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

When you run the code, it prompts you to enter the city name for which you want to fetch the weather information. It then makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves the temperature and weather condition data. Finally, it prints the information to the console.

**Note:** This is a basic implementation, and you can enhance it by adding more features such as extended forecasts, humidity, wind speed, etc., based on the data returned by the API.
